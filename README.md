# vkbot

A VK bot and unit testing task I did on my QA automation testing internship.

Details on how to run IN PROGRESS. I lost access to task description on JIRA
so recreating it is a bit of a hassle. Look at the `testData.json` file and
the `vk/tests`, the code should be more or less self-documenting.
